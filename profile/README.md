# Welcome

We are building tools for online interpersonal synchrony research and remote experiments. Below we have a couple of project you might be interested in.

- [`experimental-hub`](https://github.com/TUMFARSynchrony/experimental-hub#experimental-hub)
- [`synchrony-score`](https://github.com/TUMFARSynchrony/synchrony-score/blob/main/README.md)

## `experimental-hub`
Our `experimental-hub` is video conferencing platform that can be used by researchers to host their own custom remote experiments.

## `synchrony-score`
Our `synchrony-score` is an initial attempt at quantifying interpersonal synchrony into a single quantifiable metric! We present a current initial synchrony score as a Late-Breaking-Work at CHI '23. You can read the paper [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3544549.3585709) or watch a short demo video about it:

While an ambitious task, we envision this score to one day be used by UI and Social XR researchers in their evaluation of social online interfaces and interactions which is why we are working on integrating it as a future filter in our experimental hub.

## `Other project`
rPPG - One of the projects we will be including are works by student who developed his own rPPG pipleing to be included in the experimental hub.
